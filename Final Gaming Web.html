Speech from the creater of Blackshot sea:
<p>
The game is very addictive as you will play more of the game and 
some of them will even upload the game on YouTube.
<br>
So, the YouTube viewers 
will be impressed of the game and the game will be popular so
that a lot of people will download it and they will have to 
increase the download size of the game.
<br> 
A game that is not too 
childish and not too mature so that is suitable for all ages and
the game must be easy to play and the game.
<br>
It involves an online match. Hence, people can challenge each other and see who is better in that game.
<p> 
The game must be 13+ as the game involves gun and some 
knife and a chat in the game so that people can commutate with one 
another so that the game will not be boring, as no one will want to do 
what they want to do in the game and the game will involve real money
on some parts so that some people will buy the weapons which are more 
upgraded so that they can enjoy the game and they can enjoy the match.
<p> 
The game is only available on the computer as the
phone is too small and it has no buttons for the control.
<br> 
The game is interesting as it has a lot of missions to play and the 
missions are fun and exciting as some of the missions involve killing
your enemy or your friends then training themselves before starting
the game.
<p>
(Holiday/special events=SALE the more SALE the more events is special)
The game only accept credit card (Once bought no refund!)
